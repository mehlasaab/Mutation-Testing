# Mutation Testing with MutPy

## Overview

This repository showcases the application of mutation testing using MutPy, a Python mutation testing tool, to evaluate the effectiveness of test cases for various algorithms and data structures. The codebase covers implementations of dynamic programming problems, graph algorithms, divide and conquer strategies, bit manipulation, and sorting algorithms.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mutation-testing-mutpy.git
   ```

2. Install MutPy and dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install mutpy
   ```

3. Run mutation testing:

   ```bash
   mut.py run --target algorithms --unit-test tests
   ```

4. View reports:

   Access mutation testing reports in the `Report_Software_Testing` file for insights into test suite effectiveness.
